A step-by-step guide that shows you exactly how to export layers, frames, and other design elements from Figma.

When you're [designing with Figma](https://designlab.com/blog/ux-designer-guide-to-figma/), you can export layers, frames, or whole screen designs into JPG, PNG, SVG, or PDF image formats.

## Getting Started with Figma Exports

### Step 1: Select Design

Select the frame (or layer). You can do this by clicking on it on the design canvas itself, or via the layers and assets panel on the left.

Once you've selected the frame you'd like to export, navigate to the inspector panel on the right and scroll down to find the section labeled Export. Click on the section to expand. 

Here, you can select what format you'd like to export your design in:

* PNG
